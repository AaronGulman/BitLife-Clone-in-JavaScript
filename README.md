# BitLife rewrritten in ... JavaScript !

I am recreating a popular mobile game called "BitLife" in Javascript 
Although I chose a difficult route of writing it in pure vanilla JS it is still a lot of fun and I hope I can finish it one day.
The whole app is going to be web-based and very basic compared to the original one.
